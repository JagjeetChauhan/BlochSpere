# BlochSpere
**Description**:
BlochSphere is a simple and intuitive visualization tool for understanding quantum states using the Bloch sphere representation. This repository provides a JavaScript library that enables developers to easily integrate Bloch sphere visualizations into their quantum computing projects or educational materials.

**Features**:
Visualization of quantum states: Easily visualize the state of a qubit or a two-qubit system on the Bloch sphere.
Interactive controls: Rotate the Bloch sphere to explore different quantum states and angles.
Customization: Adjust parameters such as state vector, phase, and color scheme to tailor the visualization to your needs.
Educational tool: Ideal for teaching and learning about quantum mechanics and quantum computing concepts.
